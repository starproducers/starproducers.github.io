In this article, I will present figures on the IPs market. And from those numbers you can form your own opinion on the success of those famous IPs. The studies have been made by the European Audiovisual Observatory, all the following numbers are from this study.

In Europe, adaptations represent about 10 to 14% of all the fictions projects. This number is really well established since 2015. In those 12% of adaptations, 77% are adaptations from books, 17% from TV series, and we find after this two plays adapted, films and comics. Recently we saw some adaptations from video games but in Europe, video game adaptations are not really popular yet. This type of adaptation come mainly from US (with the adaptation of Super Mario Bros, The last of Us…), and even if it’s a beginning it’s even more rare in the series form. 

What the European Audiovisual Observatory underlined is that in books adaptation and in TV series adaptations, books are adapted by the same country as the author’s one, while TV series are re-adapted by different countries than the originals authors.

As we saw earlier, adaptation from TV series is equal to 17% of the adaptations market. In those 17% some IP are product more than just one time. The first rank is occupied by the SKAM franchise, wich has been adapted in 6 different country, with Norway as pioneer of the franchise. Then we have BeTipul also known in France as In Therapy, from Les films du poisson. The rights of the script belong to Hagai Levi, an Israeli author, who sold his right 5 times, to France, Italia, Portugal…

The UK is the country with the most adaptations projects, thanks to his literature heritage. So if you want to adapt Shakespeare, Jane Austen or Mary Shelley, you should consider a co-production with them !

Finally, with those little numbers, we can see that adaptations are established in the european market, and it’s a sure value for your future productions !
