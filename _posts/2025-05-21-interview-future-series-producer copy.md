For this article, we had the chance to interview a future series producer, Lena Sant’Anna. She explained that the reason she wants to produce series is because it was the first form of art she fell in love with when she was young. She enjoyed Desperate Housewives, Hannah Montana, and other American TV shows. All those shows she grew up with represent a deep emotional connection. Also because watching series was also a family activity. Now, producing series feels like a tribute to those memories, an accomplishment.

Moreover, she said that the strength of TV shows lies in their length, which allows a better development of universes and characters. We can see them evolve and, in a way, grow up with them. It’s also a way to promote change or a more egalitarian vision of the world, which she hopes to do, with all those shows that accompagne us during a very long time sometimes. The influence of daily shows is important in shaping our thinking and can help us evolve.

To conclude, she explained how she plans to become a TV show producer. First, she would like to learn from and observe established producers to understand the specific storytelling techniques used in series and how they are developed. She also wants to meet screenwriters. Through these initial experiences, which she told us could last up to ten years, she hopes to carve her own path as a TV show producer.
