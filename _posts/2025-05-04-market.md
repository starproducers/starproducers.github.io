One of our favorite campaign is the social media campaign created for the series Parlement.

The promotion for the latest season happened at the same time as the elections, so they came up with a clever marketing strategy: a fake election campaign.

This helped spark a worldwide debate between fans of the show’s two main teams, “green” and “black.” These campaigns show how creativity, collaboration, and interactive experiences can turn a series into a global event.
