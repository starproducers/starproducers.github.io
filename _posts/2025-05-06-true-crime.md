As we can see in the previous article about trends in the series market recently, we want to focus on the exponential success of documentary series, particularly due to the rise of true crime and sports documentaries. These genres have become extremely popular on streaming platforms, with companies like Netflix and Amazon making significant investments in documentary series. Their strategy has allowed them to reach a broad and engaged audience, especially in Western Europe and North America. Recent data from Pair Analysis and Digital Eye show that these two types of documentaries have become some of the most-watched content, not only in Europe but also worldwide.

True crime documentaries have dominated the views ranking on platforms. The number of non-scripted documentaries about real criminal cases increased by 14% last year in North America, with similar growth seen in Europe. This genre seems to be one of the audience's favorites. For example, a YouGov survey found that over 60% of women aged 18-64 in the United States enjoy watching true crime content. On platforms like Netflix, many of the top-watched series are based on real-life crime stories. In Canada, nearly 61% of subscribers watched at least 20 minutes of true crime content in 2023 (source: Série Mania Documentary Series Conference).
Netflix continues to make huge investments in local documentary series about true crime, following the success of the documentary series on the Little Gregory case and the immense popularity of The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann. True crime has dominated local investments on the platform. Even Disney+, which traditionally focused on other genres, has decided to produce a true crime series titled Les Disparues de la Gare (The Missing at the Station).

These documentaire series attract our natural curiosity about mysteries and real-life experiences, and their exceptional success on streaming platforms proves it. If you want to work with big platforms and create a series that can reach a wide audience, here’s a piece of advice: true crime seems to be a strong and promising direction to explore.
