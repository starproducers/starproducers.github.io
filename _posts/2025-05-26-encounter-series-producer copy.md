At series-mania, after the exchange about the trends in docu-series, we got the chance to talk with Dolores Emile, head of non-fiction at Netflix France. It’s a chance to have the vision of an experienced producer and even more so the point of view of a Netflix producer, Worldwide head of series-production. 

So the main question is : what are the specificities of the docu-series productions, and what are the specifics of producing series for Netflix, which has a unique way of producing? 

First of all Dolores want to look back to the beginning of Dolores' career before she got her job at Netflix France. She began with strategic jobs at NRJ (for their TV channels) and at the American media Vice. She was passionate in audiovisual and entertainment early before those experiences, she got a real vocation for entertainment. But at the beginning of her cursus she couldn’t find a specialized formation, so she chose to orient herself to the closest choice that is law and management of broadcast communications. This education gave her the access to entertainment enterprises jobs in audiovisual. And after she discovered the documentary universe with her job at vice. The fact that it is an American media gave her the opportunity to discover new ways to create documentaries, in a more fictional way. She took a lot of inspiration at American festivals in which filmmakers mixed documentaries with reality shows or docu-soap.

She wants to grow narratives American approaches, centered on emotion, dramaturgy and a dynamic narration. At the image of Netflix’s productions, closest to the fiction, not only classic scientific and expert interviews but an emotional implication. The objective for Netflix is to produce projects with a strong narrative dimension. Dolores highlight this point : “We want unique and romanesque stories”. Those stories are imbricated with other complex narratives, with a lot of twists and more-often more ambitious than a lot of fiction series. The narrative treatment goal is to create a strong emotional connection with the audience. This is the big difference between the Netflix approach and more traditional broadcaster production approaches. 

We asked her if she can give us advice for a young series-producer. She said : stay curious to create and produce new ways of storytelling. What is challenging in docu-series is the partitioning of the genre, usually when you work on fiction it’s harder to go to documentary after, but all the genres feed on each other and the spectators are wearing for more fictional incorporation in documentaries because they are used to the fictional grammar. So if you want to become a successful series-producer you need to think outside the box and also never lose your mind that you create a series for spectators and you need to focus on their needs and if the production is entertaining. “Stay ruled by emotions” said Dolores.
