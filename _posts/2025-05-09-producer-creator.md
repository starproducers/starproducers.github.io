 In series, the producer-creator relation can be a little different than in the cinema sector, or documentary…
The series market is quite different than the other, because of his success, the financial stakes are way higher than in other audiovisual sectors. Quite naturally, it may change a little bit the nature of the relation. It’s Alon Aranya producer at Paper Plane productions explains (nuances of course) that as a producer, you’ll still be part of the artistic decisions, but the series budget are so high that you have a lot of responsibility in the financial part of the process, who can overshadow a little bit your involvement in the artistic par of the series. As he said : « your financier can interfere in the balance of your collaboration, you have to be careful in this point ».

 We intentionally chose to speak about this point in first, to highlight this little difference, but it’s a minor things in the relationship, because as always, you have to consider your director or your screenwriter as a Partner. Both of you want the same thing : make the best serie as possible. You will need to complement one an other, find a balance in how powerful the other is in the different steps. 

For example, some producer like to be present for the castings. No matter the step in which you are and your role in this duo, you have to communicate about your wish, your boundaries to make this relation as good as possible and as pleasant as possible, because in the end, your series will be even better with a good producer-creator balance.

 Sheila Mortley who also spoke at the Serie Mania festival said « as a producer, you sow little fires everywhere every day, but you also do your best to finish the film ». But in our opinion, the directors can also sow little fires everywhere everyday, and they will also do their best to arrange them. And this is the essence of the partnership between producer and creator, you will both take decisions, and find the balance to arrange all of them together.
