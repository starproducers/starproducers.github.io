<p>On this website, you will find the most exhaustive list possible of articles to help you become a series producer. If you want to know more about the market and how to become one of the producers with the most ambitious projects, you're in the right place.</p>

<p>Most of my inspiration for these articles comes from the conferences at the Séries Mania Festival, which we had the chance to attend recently. Honestly, you’ll become a much better producer by going there yourself, but maybe this little website is just what you need to motivate yourself to attend the festival and meet industry professionals in person.</p>

<p>This website tries to reflect the reality of the industry as closely as possible, but if you have ideas to explore the series production landscape further, feel free to suggest articles and topics!</p>

<p>We will focus especially on the French sector, because it's where we are based, and thanks to the concept of l’exception culturelle, French series are often unique. Of course, each country has its own specialty spectacular series in the U.S., more "niche" ones in Europe…</p>

<p>Moreover, many series today are co-productions between differents countries! Don’t forget this when you produce your first show it can help you financially and help your story, because of a diversity of perspectives.</p>
